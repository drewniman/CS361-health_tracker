You are amazing!  One step at a time you are reaching your Goals!
What seems impossible today, will one day be your warm-up.
Tough times don't last but tough people do.
Our greatest glory isn't never falling, but rising every time we fall.
You can't beat the person who never gives up.
The most successful man is a normal man with laser-like focus taking it one day at a time.
If it doesn't challenge you it doesn't change you.
Nobody who gave his best ever regretted it.
Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment.
Some people want it to happen, others wish it would happen, but you are making it happen.
